```
- reference collection of 1 million images
- a development set of 50,000 query images
- test set of 50,000 additional query images

The query images are versions of reference images transformed through human and nonhuman edits to include various types of image edition, collages, and reencoding. We also provide a collection of 1 million untransformed images that can be used for training.


Images for DISC21 were sourced from the YFCC100M dataset as well as Meta AIâ€™s own Casual Conversations dataset. The YFCC100M source images were filtered to include only the broadest licenses and not include any recognizable people. Some of the images from Casual Conversations had the CIAGAN deepfake effect applied before transformation.

The data is about 350GB in total, split into 42 zip files containing 50,000 images each.
